# CS330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization
Final Project from my Computer Graphics course, using OpenGL/Blender to create a realistic 3D scene based on a 2D photo

For this project I watched a lot of videos, and read the material given to us, so as to better understand how to properly make this project come to life. Learning how to make the project flow well and run properly will help me in future projects along with the practice i had with thoroughly commenting throughout the code. Once I had a good idea of how to design the project, i moved onto the code of developing it. It was fun creating this project and I cannot wait to use the skills gained to design scenes for games i plan to make in the future as a hobby.
